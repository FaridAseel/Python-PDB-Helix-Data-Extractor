This Python script processes a PDB (Protein Data Bank) file, specifically targeting 'HELIX' records within the file. It reads the content of the file, extracting relevant information such as serial numbers, helix IDs, start and end residues, chains, helix classes, and comments associated with each 'HELIX' entry.

Using file manipulation techniques, the script creates a new file named 'helix_data.SS' to store the extracted data in a structured manner. Each line in this output file represents a 'HELIX' record, organizing the extracted details in a comma-separated format for ease of reference and analysis.

The script utilizes Python's file handling capabilities along with string parsing techniques to accurately isolate and extract the necessary information from the input PDB file. The extracted data is then written into the output file in a tabular form, allowing for further analysis or usage in downstream processes related to structural biology or protein research.
